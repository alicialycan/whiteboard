# Linked List Whiteboard Challenge

## Problem:

Write a function called `contains()` that accepts a linked list and a value.
Return true if the value is in the linked list.

## Solution:

I wrote a solution `array-list.js` that contains `isSorted()` function that accepts the LinkedList as a parameter and searches for the value inside it.
